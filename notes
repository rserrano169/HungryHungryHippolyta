notes

- start mouth closed, dir stay
- maybe don't start stepping until click or key?

- if keyed, then next dir changes
- if clicked, then BFS runs, and fills a posArray with positions
  - then BFS sets the nextDir towards the next position in
    the array on every loop
- if next dir isvalid, then dir changes
- if dir changes, then move is called,
- if move is called then position changes ***
- so, before move is called, we want to render the open mouth,
  then render the empty pos ("") or portal
  then move
  then render a closed mouth in the correct direction

WHAT WE WANT

- we only want the direction to change from a closed mouth position
- if the isNextDirValid, then setPrevHorDir, then changeDir,
  then renderMouthOpen based on prevDir and dir,
  then mouthClosed = false;
- then wait one loop. DO NOT ALLOW changeDir, and DO NOT ALLOW .move()
- on the next loop, if the mouth is open, then renderMovingFrom,
  then .move(), then renderMovingTo, always with a closed mouth,
  mouthClosed = true;

PROBLEMS

- If keyed or clicked while mouth open, nextDir gets reset,

FROM START

- dir = STAY, phd = LEFT
- key LEFT
- mouth is closed, therefore nextDir gets set
- it's valid, therefore setPHD changeDir form STAY to LEFT
- open the mouth
- do not move //

- if i key RIGHT while the mouth is open, then nextDir becomes RIGHT
- it won't changeDir until after it moves to the next position,
  and closes the mouth
- that seems fine.
-------------------------------------- BFS CLICK
- from start again, if i click somewhere, then an array fills
- the mouth is closed so on the first loop, it will set
  nextDir (LEFT) with BFS, BFSindex++(1) then open the mouth left
- it will not move. //

- the mouth is open
- if i click again while the mouth is open, the same array will fill,
  ex. [113, 114, 115, 116]
  because hippolyta is still on that tile[112], and the BFSindex
  will go back to 0
- move will be called the position will change to 113
- the mouth will be closed
- on the next loop the next dir will be
